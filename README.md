I made It because I need it for another project, and thought that It would be a good idea to upload it in this rough form just in case It helps anyone.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Warning
This project originally was build in `NEXTJS` I migrated it to vite because of `SSR` issues, It should be working now. Although the github pages `CI` Pipeline is not working and also I removed the env variables for the `public` dir prefix so you will have to add it in order to load the gesture recognition model.
